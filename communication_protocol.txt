{
    {
        type = [status|change]
        section = [board|player|misc],
        item = [],
        attribute = [],
        value = ...
    },
    ...
}

When connected to the server, clent receives message:
{
    {
        type = status,
        section = misc,
        item = my_uuid,
        value = "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx",
    }
    {
        type = status,
        section = misc,
        item = my_id,
        value = x  # 0-3
    }
}

Client sends messages to the server in this form (unlike server, client can send only one request at a time:
{
    my_uuid = xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx
    action = "xxx"
    parameters = {} # depends on the action
}

Server processes the message. If the request can't be done, sends a message to the sender only:
{
    {
        type = error,
        action = {},
        error_message = "xyz"
    }
}

Otherwise broadcasts to all players the changes

Suggestions:
    - type = status could be changed to type = init or removed completely. The original idea was that status was
      intended for client checking the values with no real value change
